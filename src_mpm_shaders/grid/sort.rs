//! Particle sorting kernels for the sparse MPM grid.
//!
//! These kernels handle:
//! 1. Marking blocks as active based on particle positions.
//! 2. Counting particles per block.
//! 3. Building sorted particle arrays.
//!
//! The sorting pipeline runs in multiple passes:
//! 1. `touch_particle_blocks` / `touch_rigid_particle_blocks` - mark active blocks
//! 2. `mark_rigid_particles_needing_block` - flag rigid particles near block boundaries
//! 3. `update_block_particle_count` - count particles per active block
//! 4. `copy_particles_len_to_scan_value` - prepare prefix sum input
//! 5. prefix sum (external) - compute exclusive scan of particle counts
//! 6. `copy_scan_values_to_first_particles` - write back sorted offsets
//! 7. `finalize_particles_sort` - place particles in sorted order
//!
//! Rigid particles go through the same count / prefix-sum / finalize sequence
//! (`update_block_rigid_particle_count`, `copy_rigid_particles_len_to_scan_value`,
//! `copy_scan_values_to_first_rigid_particles`, `finalize_rigid_particles_sort`),
//! reusing the scan workspace after the regular particle sort completed.
