/*
 * Topo-GC (Topological Graph Coloring) Algorithm
 * ==============================================================================
 *
 * Parallel graph coloring algorithm. Each iteration:
 * 1. Each uncolored node selects the smallest color not used by neighbors
 * 2. Conflicts are detected and resolved in the next iteration
 * 3. Repeat until convergence (no conflicts)
 *
 * Reference: https://people.csail.mit.edu/xchen/docs/ipdpsw-2016.pdf
 *
 * Advantages:
 * - Typically produces fewer colors than Luby (closer to optimal)
 * - Faster convergence for dense graphs
 *
 * Disadvantages:
 * - Limited to 63 colors (due to 2x u32 bitmask representation)
 * - May require more iterations than Luby in worst case
 *
 * Algorithm Steps:
 * 1. reset_topo_gc_kernel: Initialize all nodes as uncolored
 * 2. step_graph_coloring_topo_gc_kernel: Each node selects smallest available color
 * 3. fix_conflicts_topo_gc_kernel: Detect and uncolor conflicting nodes
 * 4. Repeat steps 2-3 until num_colors > 0 (no conflicts, algorithm finished)
 *
 * Color Representation:
 * Uses a 64-bit bitmask (2x u32) to track occupied colors for each node.
 * Bit i set means color i is used by a neighbor.
 * Color indices start at 1. (The index 0 is reserved as an implementation detail.)
