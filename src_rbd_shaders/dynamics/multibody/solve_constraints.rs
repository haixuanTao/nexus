//! Fused multibody PGS sweep: joint limit/motor constraints followed by
//! contact constraints, in ONE dispatch per substep phase.
//!
//! Replaces the former `gpu_mb_solve_joint_constraints` /
//! `gpu_mb_remove_solve_joint_no_bias` / `gpu_mb_solve_contact_constraints` /
//! `gpu_mb_remove_contact_constraint_bias` chain (2-3 dispatches per phase,
//! each a fully serial one-thread-per-multibody loop):
//!
//! - One 64-lane workgroup per (multibody, batch); the multibody's
//!   generalized velocities live in WORKGROUP memory for the whole sweep, so
//!   the per-constraint `Δv = delta · column` updates and the `J·v` products
//!   run one-DOF-per-lane against shared memory instead of serial storage
//!   round-trips.
//! - The bias removal that used to be a separate read-modify-write dispatch
//!   is a `use_bias` uniform: the stabilization sweep simply reads
//!   `rhs_wo_bias` (the next substep re-initializes every constraint, so the
//!   persistent rewrite was never needed).
//!
//! The arithmetic per constraint is IDENTICAL to the serial kernels (same
//! product/sum order — lane 0 accumulates the lane products in DOF order), so
//! results are bit-exact with the former chain.
